# Lab Report 5

## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

For this lab report, I designed a Java script that takes a text file with some numbers in it and prints out the factorial of each of those numbers. It has some errors that will be fixed at the end of the Piazza debugging scenario.

This is the file/directory structure:

```
labreport5/
|-- LabReport5.java
|-- test.sh
|-- text.txt
```

This is `LabReport5.java`, `test.sh`, and `text.txt` (before the errors are fixed):
